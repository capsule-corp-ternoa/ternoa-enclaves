DEPLOYMENT :   
  - GENERATE CA-CERTS INSIDE ENCLAVE
  - REMOVE or DOWNLOAD BINARY CHECKSHUM FROM GITHUB
  - REMOVE INS1ECURE COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS 
  - DOCUMENTATION

SECURITY : 
  - extract user_data from attestation report and verify the signature and block_number (consult with gramine)
  - wipe everything if TC move the Encalve to other cluster or slot?!!
  
  - [FUTURE] SIGN the responses from enclave 
  - [FUTURE] can we check requester URL or IP? What if it uses proxy?

RELIABILITY / ERROR-HANDLING / PERFORMANCE:
  - Rate Limit Quote API
  - manage unwrap()
  - ADD RPC PROBLEM/TIMEOUT handler (middleware)
  - Syncing wildcard Pagination request is needed i.e ["*", 100, 2] page size is 100, offset 2
  - return the error to sentry or other places.
  - Regular check to use Indexer/Dictionary for missing NFTs?! (with any reason)
  
  - [FUTURE] migrate the file-name of keyshares to contain last block-number they've been updated
  - [FUTURE] check nftids during sync or bacup, if it is empty, are in range, Check if new nfts are already on the disk and updated.
  - [FUTURE] use metric-server ranking instead of simple loop as Retry mechanism
  - [FUTURE] use Indexer if the difference between current_block >> past_block is large
  
  - [ANALYSIS] during backups or sync, should state of enclave be OK or Synching? [Solution = (Specific StatusCode for Wildcard)]
  - [ANALYSIS] Retry mechanism : Mark and retry later if health is not ready
  - [ANALYSIS] What if the "chosen" Enclave is not ready? (observed in dev-0)
  - [ANALYSIS] What if all clusters are down, What block_number should be set as last_sync_block
  - [ANALYSIS] Integrity of clusters is corrupted. what to do? (observed on dev-0)
  - [ANALYSIS] We are in setup or unregistered mode after being in runtime-mode, again! (observed on dev-0)
 
IDEAS : 
  - [code style] : Define macro for nft/capsule
  - [future metric server] : Proof of storage (through heart-beats)
  - [idea - future ZK]: Proof of decryption (i.e This key-share belongs to the key for decrypting the corresponding nft media file on IPFS)
