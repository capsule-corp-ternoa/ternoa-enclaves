DEPLOYMENT :   
  - DOCUMENTATION

SECURITY : 
  - SIGN/Encrypt the responses from enclave 
  
RELIABILITY / ERROR-HANDLING / PERFORMANCE:
  - Rate Limit Quote API
  - ADD RPC PROBLEM/TIMEOUT handler (middleware)
  - Syncing wildcard Pagination request is needed i.e ["*", 100, 2] page size is 100, offset 2
  - use metric-server ranking instead of simple loop as Retry mechanism
  - Regular check to use Indexer/Dictionary for missing NFTs?! (with any reason)
  
IDEAS : 
  - [code style] : Define macro for nft/capsule
  - [future metric server] : Proof of storage (through heart-beats)
  - [idea - future ZK]: Proof of decryption (i.e This key-share belongs to the key for decrypting the corresponding nft media file on IPFS)
  - SGX sealed data access prevention
  - (Verifiable) Key-shares randomness check
  - Substrate Extrisic for encapsulated Symmetric Key
  - Sqlite3 or DB synchronization for backup
  - ZK or how to check if a share belongs to a set?
  - Evolutionary Dynamic Royalties
  - Executable NFT
  - NFT Bartering
  - Composable/Functional/Homomorphic NFT
